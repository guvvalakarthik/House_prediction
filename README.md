\# House Price Prediction System 🏠



This project is a Machine Learning–based House Price Prediction system that predicts house prices based on various geographical and demographic features.  

The model is trained using \*\*Linear Regression\*\* and deployed as a \*\*Streamlit web application\*\*.

\## 📊 Features Used

The following features are used for prediction:



\- \*\*MedInc\*\* – Median income

\- \*\*HouseAge\*\* – Age of the house

\- \*\*AveRooms\*\* – Average number of rooms

\- \*\*AveBedrms\*\* – Average number of bedrooms

\- \*\*Population\*\* – Population in the area

\- \*\*AveOccup\*\* – Average occupancy

\- \*\*Latitude\*\* – Latitude of the location

\- \*\*Longitude\*\* – Longitude of the location
